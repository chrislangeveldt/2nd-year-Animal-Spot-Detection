## Project description
In this project, you must implement a program in Java that, given an image of a cheetah, recognise and
count the number of spots on the cheetah. The project will be assessed in two separate phases: the first
phase involves grey-scaling, noise removal and edge detection using cellular automata, while the second
phase involves the counting of the spots, based on spot detection using masks of various sizes.
